# Sets, Hash Sets, Linked Lists, Hash Maps, and LRU Caches
#### or Learning How a Hash Map Works
Develop understanding of Hash Maps by building a Set and gradually adding functionality. We followed this order:
* __IntSet__ - Build a set (or bag) that stores only Integers 
* __Hashing__ - Develop hash functions that provide unique yet deterministic values for objects
* __HashSets__ - Create a Set that uses hashing to create near-unique indices
* __Linked Lists__ - Create a Linked List with basic iterating functionality
* __Hash Maps__ - Create a full Hash Map using our custom hashing methods and Linked Lists to handle collisions
* __LRU Caches__ - Use our custom Hash Map class and Linked List to create a cache that store least recently used data
