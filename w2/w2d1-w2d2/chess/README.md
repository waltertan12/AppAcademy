# Chess

A ruby implementation of the game Narrow Chess.

This project focused on learning object-oriented design patterns with emphasis on encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Uses the null object pattern for pieces.

Additionally, the game uses modules to group similar functionality.

Chess is divided into multiple classes: 
* Pieces 
  * Piece
  * Empty
  * King
  * Queen
  * Knight
  * Rook
  * Bishop
  * Pawn 
* Board
* Display
* Game

To run the game, type `ruby game.rb`. Use the arrow keys to move the cursor and space or enter to make a selection.
