# AppAcademy Exercises

This repository contains projects and exercises given at [AppAcademy](http://appacademy.io)

#### [Week 1](w1)
Focused on basic data structures (Arrays, Hashes, Trees), algorithms (breadth first search, depth first search), and recursion. Implemented these concepts in multiple projects.

#### [Week 2](w2)
Focused on good object-oriented design patterns, algorithmic complexity, Big O notation, test driven development via RSpec, and abstract data structures.

#### [Week 3](w3)
Developed an understanding of Models in the MVC design pattern by first learning SQL and then Active Record. Built multiple APIs that render JSON objects. Used Ruby metaprogramming and SQL to build a 'lite' version of Active Record.

#### [Week 4](w4)
Developed an understanding of Views and Controllers in the MVC design pattern by building views using ERB and routing actions through controllers. Learned about and implemented user authentication best practices. Explored methods to minimize database queries using ActiveRecord methods like `includes`, `eager_load`, and `inverse_of`.
