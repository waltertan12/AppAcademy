# Tic Tac Toe AI
Implement an AI to play Tic Tac Toe. Implements a tree structure and depth first searching to plot all possible moves. The AI then looks at the current state of the game and the final outcomes of the next move. If there is still a possibility for the AI to win, it will follow the path to a winning solution. If there is not winning solution, the AI will select a non-losing path.

To play against the AI, type `ruby tic_tac_toe.rb`. But seriously, it isn't fun -- you can't beat the AI...
