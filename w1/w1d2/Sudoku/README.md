# Sudoku
A Ruby implementation of [Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku).

To run the game, type in `ruby Sudoku.rb`. The terminal will then ask you if you would like to load a Sudoku board. If you type 'Y', it will then ask you for the location of the board (NOTE: There are sudoku boards stored in the directory /Sudoku-Boards/). Otherwise, the game will populate with a random board.

A white number is not changeable. A red number indicates a blank cell. A green number indicates a move you have made.
