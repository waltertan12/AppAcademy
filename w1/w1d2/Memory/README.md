# Memory
A Ruby implementation of [Memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_%28game%29) playable in the terminal.

To run the game, type `ruby Memory.rb`. The game will ask you to type in your name. If you type `Computer Player 9000` as your name, the game will run with an AI i.e. you don't get to play. If you type anything else, you will get to play. 

The terminal will prompt you to flip cards over by asking you to type in coordinates in the format `row, col`.

You have an infinite number of terms to finish the game.
