# Minesweeper
---------------

This is the classic minesweeper game built with Ruby.

Type in `ruby Minesweeper.rb` in the terminal to run the game.

To play, enter the row and column number of the cell you'd like to manipulate in the format `0,1` (you can add spaces in between, it doesn't matter). Then, type in the action you'd like to take by writing `f` to flag, `u` to unflag, or `r` to reveal.

To save the game, simply type `save` at any point. The terminal will then prompt you to enter a filename to save the game to.

To reopen a saved game, type `Y` when the game asks to load a file. Then, type in the location of the file.
