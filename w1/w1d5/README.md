# Minesweeper
---------------

Classic minesweeper game built with Ruby.

Type in `ruby Game.rb` in the terminal to run the game.

To play, enter the row and column number of the cell you'd like to manipulate in the format `0, 1`. Then, type in the action you'd like to take by writing `f` to flag, `r` to reveal, and `u` to unflag.

To save the game, simply type `exit` at any point. The terminal will then prompt you to enter a filename to save the game to.

To reopen the game, simply type in `ruby Game.rb your-saved-file.the-extension-you-used`
